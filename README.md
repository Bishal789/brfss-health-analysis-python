# ðŸ§ª BRFSS Health Data Analysis & Regression with Python

This project explores health-related data from the **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)** using Python. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in **weight change** over time based on demographics such as age, sex, and prior weight. Additionally, the project applies a **simple linear regression model** to estimate housing prices from square footage, showcasing predictive modeling using `scikit-learn`.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Explore weight change patterns in public health data
- Analyze correlations between current/past weight, height, and age
- Visualize relationships through scatter plots
- Apply a simple linear regression model to real-world housing data
- Demonstrate basic statistical reasoning and prediction

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used

- `pandas` â€“ Data manipulation and exploration
- `matplotlib` â€“ Visualizations (scatter plots)
- `scikit-learn` â€“ Linear regression modeling
- `Jupyter Notebook` â€“ Code organization and presentation

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Analyses

### âœ… BRFSS Health Data
- Summary statistics (mean, median, std deviation)
- Scatter plots:
  - Weight change vs current weight
  - Weight change vs weight a year ago
  - Weight change vs age
- Correlation coefficients for each comparison
- Finding: **Previous weight has the strongest correlation with weight change**

### âœ… Linear Regression (Bonus Task)
- Used a housing dataset to model house prices based on size
- Built a regression line using `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn
- Prediction: A 2,500 sqft house is estimated at **$326,000**
